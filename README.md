for the STDIO Ghana team working on the employee aspect of hospital administration

Managing hospital employees in Scorpion Hospital is a real chaos. Employees first login by signing an attendance book. Profiles of employees are kept in paper folders and kept in the file room in alphabetical order. When an update is to be made on the profile of an employee, folders need to be searched for in the file room which is a tedious job. Next, the space occupied by those folders that have been kept on employees over the years are being wasted. It is also hard to remove the names of employees who have departed the hospital from the file system. Our system will solve the problems stated above by automating the system.
